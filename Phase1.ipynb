    "### Our Motivation \n",
    "The \"Obesity Levels\" dataset has captured our interest because obesity is a major public health issue with significant consequences. By examining this dataset, we hope to uncover the key factors contributing to obesity and leverage machine learning models to enhance our ability to classify and predict obesity levels. Understanding these factors will empower individuals and healthcare professionals to create more effective prevention strategies, ultimately reducing obesity rates and improving public health outcomes.

    "### Our Goal \n",
    "Our goal is to create a machine-learning model that predicts individual obesity levels using both classification and clustering techniques. The classification approach will enable us to train the model to differentiate between individuals with different obesity levels based on a variety of health, dietary, and lifestyle factors. Clustering, on the other hand, will help identify hidden patterns in the dataset by grouping individuals with similar obesity risk profiles. These clusters will then assist in predicting obesity levels for new individuals by analyzing their resemblance to existing groups."
